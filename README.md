Overview
This repository contains the implementation of a Neural Network for Brain Tumor Detection from MRI images. The neural network model is trained to classify brain MRI images into two categories: Normal and Tumor. The dataset used for training the model consists of MRI images provided for brain tumor detection.

The dataset is sourced from Brain MRI Images Dataset for Tumor Detection.
